# Natural Language Processing - Distributed Methods

This project aims conduct distributed data cleaning and wrangling processing on a huge dataset. This set of codes can be leveraged and scaled to any project that involves memory-intensive tasks.

I crawled this dataset from scratch using the new Twitter API v2 via the twarc package.
